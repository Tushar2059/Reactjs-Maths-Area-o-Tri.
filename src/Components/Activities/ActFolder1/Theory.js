                A triangle is one of the basic shapes in geometry a polygon with
                three corners or vertices and three sides or edges which are
                line segments. See Fig. (A).

                <li>In Fig. (B), the line PA is parallel to the line BC. Here you can see how triangles can be on same base and between the same parallel lines.</li>
                <li>BC is the common (or same) base for two triangles ABC and PBC in Fig. (B).</li>
                <li>From the figure we can say that the base (BC) for both triangles is same/equal because both triangles are mounted on the same base.</li>

              </div>

              <p>
              From the Fig. (C), we can also say that the height of both triangles is same 
              because triangles are in between two parallel lines and if two lines are parallel
               then distance between them is constant. 
               Thus, the height of both triangles is same .

                    An Algebraic identity is an equality, which is true for all
